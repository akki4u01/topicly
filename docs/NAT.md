# NAT

### NAT Interview Questions (FAANG Style)

### Basic

- What is NAT and why is it used in networks?
- Explain the difference between static NAT, dynamic NAT, and PAT (Port Address Translation).
- How does NAT work at a high level?
- What are the benefits and drawbacks of using NAT?
- What is the difference between NAT and PAT?

### Intermediate

- How does NAT affect the TCP/IP packet structure?
- How does NAT handle incoming traffic when multiple hosts share a single public IP?
- Explain how NAT traversal works for protocols like SIP or FTP that embed IP addresses in payloads.
- What is the impact of NAT on end-to-end connectivity and peer-to-peer applications?
- How does NAT interact with firewall rules and security policies?
- Describe the NAT translation table and how entries are maintained and timed out.

### Advanced

- How do devices behind NAT establish connections to external hosts? What role does PAT play here?
- Explain the concept of NAT hairpinning (NAT loopback) and its use cases.
- How can NAT cause issues with IPv6 transition mechanisms like NAT64?
- What are the limitations of NAT in modern networks and how are they addressed?
- How does Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) differ from traditional NAT?
- Describe the challenges NAT poses for protocols requiring end-to-end visibility (e.g., IPsec, WebRTC).
- How do Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) assist NAT with protocol-specific issues?
- Explain how NAT affects traceability and logging in network security.
- How would you design a scalable NAT solution for a large enterprise or ISP?

# DHCP Interview Questions (FAANG Style)

### Basic Level

- **What is DHCP and why is it used?**
    
    ### **What is DHCP?**
    
    - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a network management protocol used to **automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters** to devices (clients) on a network.
    - It allows devices to **obtain IP addresses dynamically** instead of requiring manual configuration.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Why is DHCP Used?**
    
    - **Simplifies network administration:** Automates the assignment of IP addresses, reducing manual errors and administrative overhead.
    - **Efficient IP address management:** Avoids IP conflicts by dynamically allocating IPs from a predefined pool (scope).
    - **Supports mobile and transient devices:** Devices can join and leave the network seamlessly, getting an IP address as needed.
    - **Provides additional configuration:** DHCP can supply other important info like subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, and more.
    - **Enables scalability:** Works well in large networks with many devices, making IP management practical.

    ### Summary in One Line:
    
    > DHCP is used to automatically and dynamically assign IP addresses and network settings to devices, making network management easier, scalable, and less error-prone.

- **Explain the DHCP lease process — how does a client obtain an IP address?**
    
    # ✅ DHCP Lease Process — How a Client Obtains an IP Address
    
    ---
    
    ## Step 1: DHCPDISCOVER (Client → Broadcast) -
    
    - When a device (client) connects to a network and needs an IP address, it **does not know any DHCP server’s IP**.
    - It sends a **DHCPDISCOVER** message as a **broadcast** (`255.255.255.255`)  from UDP 68(Client) to UDP port 67(Ser port to find any available DHCP servers.
    - This message basically says:
        
        > "Is there a DHCP server out there? I need an IP address!"
        > 
    
    ---
    
    ## Step 2: DHCPOFFER (Server → Broadcast/Unicast)
    
    - One or more DHCP servers respond with a **DHCPOFFER** message.
    - The offer contains:
        - An available **IP address** from the server’s pool (scope).
        - **Lease duration** (how long the client can use the IP).
        - Other network info (subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers, etc.).
    - The offer is usually sent as a **broadcast or unicast** to the client’s MAC address.
    
    ---
    
    ## Step 3: DHCPREQUEST (Client → Broadcast)
    
    - The client selects one of the received offers (typically the first) and sends a **DHCPREQUEST** message.
    - This message is broadcasted to inform **all DHCP servers** about the selected server and the requested IP.
    - It serves two purposes:
        1. **Requesting the offered IP address** formally.
        2. **Declining other offers**, so those servers know their offers were rejected.
    
    ---
    
    ## Step 4: DHCPACK (Server → Broadcast/Unicast)
    
    - The chosen DHCP server responds with a **DHCPACK (acknowledgment)** message.
    - This confirms the lease of the IP address to the client and includes all network parameters.
    - Once the client receives DHCPACK, it can configure its network interface with the assigned IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS, etc.
    
    ---
    
    ## Optional Steps
    
    - If the server cannot assign the IP (e.g., it was taken by another client), it can respond with **DHCPNAK (negative acknowledgment)**, and the client restarts the process.
    - If the client has a previously assigned IP but reboots or reconnects, it sends a DHCPREQUEST for that IP (called a **renewal**).
    
    ---
    
    ## Step 5: Lease Renewal (DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK)
    
    - Before the lease expires (typically at 50% lease time), the client tries to **renew** its lease by sending a DHCPREQUEST **directly** to the DHCP server.
    - The server responds with DHCPACK to extend the lease.
    
    - If renewal fails, the client tries rebinding (broadcast DHCPREQUEST) to any server.

    # 🧠 ELI5 Analogy: Getting a Library Card
    
    - You walk into a **library** (network) but don’t have a membership card (IP).
    - You shout out loud:
        
        > “Is there anyone here who can give me a card?” (DHCPDISCOVER)
        > 
    - Several librarians (DHCP servers) reply:
        
        > “I can give you card #12345 valid for 7 days, here’s the info you need.” (DHCPOFFER)
        > 
    - You choose one librarian and say:
        
        > “I want card #12345 from you.” (DHCPREQUEST)
        > 
    - That librarian confirms and officially issues the card:
        
        > “Here’s your card and info.” (DHCPACK)
        > 
    - Now you can use the library (network) freely.
    - Before your card expires, you ask the librarian to renew it so you don’t lose access (lease renewal).

    # 🧠 Interview Summary
    
    > The DHCP lease process uses a four-step handshake — Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge — to dynamically assign IP addresses and network settings to clients. This process ensures unique IP allocation, avoids conflicts, and allows easy lease renewal.
    > 
- **What are the different DHCP message types? Describe the DHCP handshake.**
    
    # ✅ DHCP Message Types & DHCP Handshake
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔹 Different DHCP Message Types
    
    DHCP messages are carried inside UDP packets and each message has a **“message type” option** that indicates its purpose. The key DHCP message types used during the IP address assignment process are:
    
    | **Message Type** | **Purpose** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **DHCPDISCOVER (1)** | Client broadcasts to locate available DHCP servers. |
    | **DHCPOFFER (2)** | Server offers an IP address and configuration to the client. |
    | **DHCPREQUEST (3)** | Client requests the offered IP address and signals intent to use it. |
    | **DHCPDECLINE (4)** | Client informs the server the offered IP is already in use (conflict). |
    | **DHCPACK (5)** | Server acknowledges and confirms the IP lease to the client. |
    | **DHCPNAK (6)** | Server denies the request (e.g., IP no longer available). |
    | **DHCPRELEASE (7)** | Client releases the IP address back to the server. |
    | **DHCPINFORM (8)** | Client requests only local configuration parameters, not an IP lease. |
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔹 DHCP Handshake — How It Works (The Four-Step Process)
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 1: **DHCPDISCOVER**
    
    - When a client first joins a network, it sends a **DHCPDISCOVER** message as a **broadcast** to find DHCP servers.
    - Since the client has no IP yet, it uses `0.0.0.0` as the source IP and broadcast destination.
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 2: **DHCPOFFER**
    
    - DHCP servers that receive the DHCPDISCOVER respond with **DHCPOFFER** messages.
    - Each offer includes an available IP address and other network configuration details (subnet mask, gateway, DNS, lease time).
    - This message can be broadcast or unicast to the client’s MAC address.
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 3: **DHCPREQUEST**
    
    - The client selects one offer and broadcasts a **DHCPREQUEST** message to:
        - Inform **all DHCP servers** which offer it accepted.
        - Request the offered IP formally from the chosen server.
    - Broadcasting informs other DHCP servers to withdraw their offers.
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 4: **DHCPACK**
    
    - The chosen DHCP server sends a **DHCPACK** message, confirming the lease.
    - Upon receipt, the client configures its network interface with the assigned IP and other parameters.
    
    ---
    
    ### If the server cannot assign the requested IP (e.g., IP conflict or lease expired), it sends a **DHCPNAK**, and the client restarts the process.

- **What information can DHCP provide to a client besides the IP address?**
    
    # ✅ What Information Can DHCP Provide Besides the IP Address?
    
    ---
    
    DHCP is designed not only to assign IP addresses but also to supply a variety of important network configuration parameters to clients, allowing them to fully configure their network interface automatically.
    
    ---
    
    ### Common DHCP Configuration Parameters (Options) Provided:
    
    | **Parameter** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Subnet Mask (Option 1)** | Defines the network portion of the IP address. |
    | **Default Gateway / Router (Option 3)** | IP address of the router to which packets for other networks are sent. |
    | **Domain Name Server (DNS) (Option 6)** | IP addresses of DNS servers used for resolving domain names. |
    | **Domain Name (Option 15)** | The DNS domain name the client should use. |
    | **Lease Time (Option 51)** | Duration the IP address lease is valid. |
    | **Renewal Time (T1) & Rebinding Time (T2) (Options 58 & 59)** | Timers for lease renewal and rebinding process. |
    | **Broadcast Address (Option 28)** | The network’s broadcast address. |
    | **NTP Servers (Option 42)** | Network Time Protocol servers for time synchronization. |
    | **NetBIOS Name Servers (Option 44)** | IP addresses for NetBIOS name resolution (Windows networks). |
    | **WINS Servers (Option 46)** | IP addresses of Windows Internet Name Service servers. |
    | **MTU Size (Option 26)** | Maximum Transmission Unit size for the interface. |
    | **Static Routes (Option 33)** | Routes that the client should add to its routing table. |
    | **Classless Static Route Option (Option 121)** | Allows specifying destination networks and their next-hop routers. |
    | **Vendor-Specific Information (Option 43)** | Custom parameters for vendor-specific needs. |
    
    ---
    
    ### Why Is This Useful?
    
    - Provides a **complete network configuration** without manual intervention.
    - Ensures clients use the **correct gateway and DNS servers** to communicate beyond the local subnet.
    - Helps maintain **network consistency and ease of management**.
    - Enables clients to participate in specialized services (e.g., time sync, name resolution).
    - Supports **custom and vendor-specific configurations** for specialized network environments.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > Besides IP address, DHCP provides clients with network settings like subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, lease times, and other options such as NTP servers and static routes, enabling full automatic network configuration.

- **What is the role of a DHCP relay agent?**
    
    # ✅ What is the Role of a DHCP Relay Agent?
    
    ---
    
    ### 🎯 Purpose:
    
    A **DHCP Relay Agent** enables DHCP clients on one subnet (broadcast domain) to communicate with a DHCP server on a different subnet.
    
    ---
    
    ### Why Is It Needed?
    
    - **DHCP messages like DHCPDISCOVER are broadcasts**, which **do not pass through routers**.
    - Routers block broadcasts by default, so a DHCP client on one subnet **cannot directly reach a DHCP server on another subnet**.
    - To overcome this, a **DHCP relay agent** listens for DHCP broadcast messages on a local subnet and **forwards** them as unicast messages to a DHCP server on a different subnet.
    
    ---
    
    ### How It Works:
    
    1. **Client sends DHCPDISCOVER** (broadcast) on its local subnet.
    2. The **DHCP relay agent intercepts this broadcast**.
    3. Relay agent **encapsulates the DHCP message inside a unicast** and sends it to the configured DHCP server’s IP address.
    4. The DHCP server processes the request and sends the response **back to the relay agent**.
    5. Relay agent then **forwards the DHCP response back to the client** on the original subnet.
    
    ---
    
    ### Key Points:
    
    - Relay agents include the **“giaddr” (Gateway IP address)** field in the forwarded DHCP messages to indicate the subnet from which the request originated.
    - The DHCP server uses `giaddr` to determine the appropriate IP address pool to allocate from.
    - Relay agents allow centralized DHCP servers to serve multiple subnets, simplifying network management.
    
    ---
    
    ### Real-World Example:
    
    - Imagine a large company with many VLANs/subnets.
    - Instead of having a DHCP server in each subnet, a **single DHCP server** in a central location can serve all.
    - **DHCP relay agents run on routers or Layer 3 devices** connecting those subnets, forwarding DHCP messages across subnet boundaries.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > A DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP broadcast requests from clients on one subnet to a DHCP server on another subnet, enabling centralized IP address management across multiple networks by overcoming router broadcast limitations.

### Intermediate Level

- **How does DHCP handle IP address conflicts?**
    
    # ✅ How Does DHCP Handle IP Address Conflicts?
    
    ---
    
    ### What is an IP Address Conflict?
    
    - Occurs when **two devices on the same network have the same IP address**.
    - Leads to communication problems like packet loss, connection drops, and network instability.
    
    ---
    
    ### How DHCP Prevents and Detects Conflicts:
    
    ---
    
    ## 1. **Conflict Detection via ARP Probe (Optional but Recommended)**
    
    - Before **assigning an IP address to a client**, some DHCP servers **send an ARP request (probe)** to check if the IP is already in use on the network.
    - If the server **receives an ARP reply**, it knows the IP is taken and **will not assign that address**.
    - If no reply, the server assumes the IP is free and leases it.
    
    ---
    
    ## 2. **Client-Side Conflict Detection (ARP Probe by Client)**
    
    - Some DHCP clients also perform an **ARP probe** for the offered IP address **before using it**.
    - If the client detects that another device is already using the IP (receives an ARP reply), it **notifies the user or rejects the IP**, triggering a DHCP request for a new IP.
    
    ---
    
    ## 3. **Handling Conflict After Lease**
    
    - If a device starts using an IP and detects conflicts (e.g., via ICMP or ARP), it can send a **DHCPDECLINE** message to the DHCP server.
    - DHCPDECLINE informs the server that the assigned IP is problematic.
    - The DHCP server marks that IP as bad/unusable and **removes it from the available pool**.
    - The server then offers a new IP address to the client.
    
    ---
    
    ## 4. **Administrative Actions**
    
    - Network admins can manually reserve IPs or monitor conflict reports.
    - Proper DHCP scope management and static IP assignment policies reduce conflicts.
    
    ---
    
    ### Summary Flow:
    
    | Event | DHCP Action |
    | --- | --- |
    | IP offered | Server or client sends ARP probe to verify usage |
    | IP conflict detected on client | Client sends DHCPDECLINE to server |
    | Server receives DHCPDECLINE | Marks IP as conflicted, excludes it from pool |
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > DHCP handles IP conflicts by optionally probing IP availability using ARP before assignment, allowing clients to detect conflicts via ARP, and responding to client-sent DHCPDECLINE messages to remove conflicted IPs from the pool, ensuring unique IP allocation on the network.
    > 
- **What happens when a DHCP lease expires?**
    
    # ✅ What Happens When a DHCP Lease Expires?
    
    ---
    
    ### What is a DHCP Lease?
    
    - When a DHCP server assigns an IP address to a client, it grants a **lease** — a time-limited permission to use that IP.
    - The **lease duration** is specified in the DHCPACK message.
    - After this lease period, the client must renew it to keep using the IP.
    
    ---
    
    ### Lease Expiration Process
    
    ---
    
    ## 1. **Lease Renewal Attempts**
    
    - **At 50% of the lease time elapsed (T1 timer)**:
        - The client attempts to **renew the lease by sending a DHCPREQUEST directly to the original DHCP server** (unicast).
        - If the server responds with DHCPACK, the lease is extended with a new lease time.
    
    ---
    
    ## 2. **Rebinding Attempts**
    
    - **At 87.5% of the lease time elapsed (T2 timer)**:
        - If the client did not receive a response to its renewal request, it enters the **rebinding state**.
        - The client broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST message to **any available DHCP server** to renew the lease.
        - This is to allow other DHCP servers to respond if the original server is unavailable.
    
    ---
    
    ## 3. **Lease Expiration**
    
    - If the client **does not receive any DHCPACK by the lease expiration time** (100% of lease), it:
        - **Stops using the IP address**.
        - Must **stop sending packets using the expired IP** to avoid conflicts.
        - Returns to the initial state and begins the **DHCPDISCOVER** process to obtain a new IP address.
    
    ---
    
    ### Why Is This Important?
    
    - Ensures IP addresses are **not held indefinitely** by clients that may have left the network.
    - Helps DHCP servers **reclaim and reassign IPs** efficiently.
    - Avoids IP conflicts caused by clients using expired leases.
    
    ---
    
    ### Summary Flow:
    
    | Time Elapsed | Client Action |
    | --- | --- |
    | 50% (T1) | Sends unicast DHCPREQUEST to renew lease |
    | 87.5% (T2) | Broadcasts DHCPREQUEST to any DHCP server |
    | 100% (Lease Expiration) | Stops using IP and restarts DHCP discovery |
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > When a DHCP lease expires, the client first tries to renew it with the original server at 50% lease time, rebinding with any server at 87.5%, and if renewal fails, it stops using the IP and restarts the DHCP process to get a new address, ensuring efficient IP address reuse.

- **Explain the difference between DHCP reservation and dynamic allocation.**
    
    # ✅ Difference Between DHCP Reservation and Dynamic Allocation
    
    ---
    
    ### 1. **Dynamic Allocation**
    
    - **What it is:**
        
        The DHCP server automatically assigns IP addresses from a predefined pool (scope) to clients on a **first-come, first-served basis**.
        
    - **How it works:**
        - When a client requests an IP, the server picks an **available IP address** from its dynamic pool and leases it temporarily.
        - The IP is assigned **for a limited lease time**, after which it can be reassigned to other clients if not renewed.
        - IP addresses are **not fixed**; clients may get different IPs on different connections.
    - **Use cases:**
        - General networks with many devices that frequently join or leave.
        - Environments where IP addresses don’t need to be consistent.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **DHCP Reservation (Static Allocation)**
    
    - **What it is:**
        
        The DHCP server is configured to always assign the **same IP address to a specific client** based on its **MAC address**.
        
    - **How it works:**
        - The admin creates a **reservation entry** binding a client’s MAC address to a specific IP.
        - When that client requests an IP, the server **always responds with the reserved IP**.
        - The reserved IP can still be managed and leased by DHCP, but it remains constant for that device.
    - **Use cases:**
        - Devices that need a **fixed IP address** but still want DHCP management (e.g., printers, servers, network equipment).
        - Simplifies management compared to manual static IP configuration on the device.
        - Ensures predictable addressing for devices that need it.
    
    ---
    
    ### Summary Table:
    
    | Feature | Dynamic Allocation | DHCP Reservation |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | IP assignment | Automatically from a pool | Manually bound to MAC address |
    | IP address consistency | Can change over time | Always the same IP for that client |
    | Lease time | Time-limited lease, can expire | Lease time still applies but IP is fixed |
    | Management overhead | Low | Requires manual reservation setup |
    | Typical devices | User laptops, smartphones, guest devices | Printers, servers, network devices |
    
    ---
    
    ### 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > Dynamic allocation assigns IPs from a pool temporarily to any client, while DHCP reservation binds a specific IP to a client’s MAC address, ensuring the client always receives the same IP via DHCP.

- **How does DHCPv6 differ from DHCPv4?**
    
    # ✅ Differences Between DHCPv6 and DHCPv4
    
    | Aspect | DHCPv4 | DHCPv6 |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Protocol version** | For IPv4 networks | For IPv6 networks |
    | **Addressing** | Assigns IPv4 addresses (32-bit) | Assigns IPv6 addresses (128-bit) |
    | **Message format and ports** | Uses UDP ports 67 (server) and 68 (client) | Uses UDP ports 546 (client) and 547 (server) |
    | **Address configuration** | Provides IP address and subnet mask | Provides IPv6 address and prefix length |
    | **Stateless vs Stateful** | Primarily **stateful** (manages IP leases) | Supports both **stateful** and **stateless** modes: |
    - Stateful: Assigns IPv6 addresses dynamically
    - Stateless: Provides other config like DNS without assigning address (SLAAC used for address) |
        
        | **Router Advertisement (RA)** | No involvement in DHCP                               | RA messages by routers inform clients about prefix and whether to use DHCPv6 |
        
        | **Prefix Delegation**          | Not supported                                        | Supports prefix delegation to assign prefixes to routers |
        
        | **Relay Agent Information**   | Uses "giaddr" field                                  | Uses "Relay Agent Information Option"                   |
        
        | **Client Identifier**          | Uses MAC-based or client-generated identifiers       | Uses DUID (DHCP Unique Identifier) for client IDs       |
        
        | **Lease Renewal**              | Similar lease renewal and rebinding timers          | Similar concept with different message formats          |
        
        | **Additional options**         | Standard options (DNS, gateway, etc.)                | Similar options plus IPv6-specific options               |
        
    
    ---
    
    ## Key Concept: SLAAC and DHCPv6
    
    - **Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)** lets IPv6 devices self-configure addresses based on router advertisements **without DHCP**.
    - DHCPv6 complements SLAAC by providing **other config info** (DNS, domain names) or full stateful address assignment.
    - DHCPv6 is more flexible but also more complex due to coexistence with SLAAC.
    
    ---
    
    ## Summary
    
    | Feature | DHCPv4 | DHCPv6 |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | IP version | IPv4 | IPv6 |
    | Address configuration | Yes (mandatory) | Yes (optional, supports SLAAC) |
    | Stateless configuration | No | Yes |
    | Port numbers | 67/68 | 546/547 |
    | Client ID | MAC or client-generated | DUID |
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > DHCPv6 is designed for IPv6 and supports both stateful and stateless address configuration, works alongside SLAAC, uses different ports and identifiers (DUID), and includes features like prefix delegation, differentiating it from DHCPv4, which is strictly for IPv4 and primarily stateful.

- **What is the purpose of the DHCP DISCOVER and DHCP OFFER messages?**
    
    # ✅ Purpose of DHCP DISCOVER and DHCP OFFER Messages
    
    ---
    
    ### 1. **DHCPDISCOVER**
    
    - **What it is:**
        
        The very first message sent by a client when it wants to obtain an IP address on a network.
        
    - **Purpose:**
        - It is a **broadcast message** that seeks to discover available DHCP servers on the local network.
        - Since the client does not have an IP address yet, it uses the special IP `0.0.0.0` as source and broadcasts to `255.255.255.255`.
        - Essentially, the client is saying:
            
            > "Is there any DHCP server out there that can give me an IP address?"
            > 
    - **How it works:**
        
        The message travels through the local subnet, reaching all DHCP servers or relay agents configured to forward DHCP requests.
        
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **DHCPOFFER**
    
    - **What it is:**
        
        A response message sent by one or more DHCP servers after receiving a DHCPDISCOVER.
        
    - **Purpose:**
        - To **offer an IP address** and network configuration details to the client.
        - Each DHCP server that receives the DISCOVER message can respond with an OFFER.
        - The offer includes:
            - An available IP address from the server’s pool.
            - Lease time (how long the client can use the IP).
            - Other parameters like subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, etc.
    - **How it works:**
        
        The server sends the offer as a **broadcast or unicast** message back to the client’s MAC address.
        
    
    ---
    
    ### Why Are These Messages Important?
    
    - The **DISCOVER message initiates** the DHCP lease negotiation.
    - The **OFFER message lets clients know their options**, including which server can provide an IP and what that IP is.
    - Multiple offers can be received; the client selects one and proceeds with the DHCPREQUEST message.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > The DHCPDISCOVER message is the client’s broadcast request to locate DHCP servers and obtain an IP address, while the DHCPOFFER message is the server’s reply offering an IP lease and network configuration to the client.

    ---
    
    ### 7. **Monitoring and Analytics**
    
    - Continuously monitor DHCP server performance and lease usage.
    - Analyze lease trends to forecast capacity needs.
    - Use automated alerts for lease exhaustion or unusual activity.
    
    ---
    
    ### 8. **Automation and Configuration Management**
    
    - Use tools like **Ansible, Puppet, or Chef** for automated deployment and consistent configuration across DHCP servers.
    - Automate DHCP scope updates and reservations as part of network provisioning workflows.
    
    ---
    
    ### 9. **Support for IPv6**
    
    - Ensure DHCP infrastructure supports **DHCPv6** and coexists properly with **SLAAC**.
    - Plan IPv6 scopes and address delegation carefully.

- **What security vulnerabilities exist in DHCP, and how can they be mitigated?**
    
    # ✅ DHCP Security Vulnerabilities & Mitigations
    
    ---
    
    ### Common Vulnerabilities
    
    | Vulnerability | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Rogue DHCP Servers** | Unauthorized DHCP servers provide incorrect IP configurations, leading to man-in-the-middle attacks or denial of service. |
    | **DHCP Starvation Attacks** | Attackers exhaust the DHCP server’s IP pool by flooding it with fake DHCP requests, preventing legitimate clients from getting IPs. |
    | **IP Spoofing** | An attacker pretends to be a legitimate client by using a spoofed MAC or IP address to gain network access or disrupt services. |
    | **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** | Rogue DHCP servers can direct clients to attacker-controlled gateways or DNS servers to intercept traffic. |
    | **Lack of Authentication** | DHCP does not natively authenticate clients or servers, making it vulnerable to impersonation. |
    | **DHCP Message Forgery** | Attackers can forge DHCP messages to disrupt IP assignment or inject malicious configurations. |
    
    ---
    
    ### Mitigation Strategies
    
    ---
    
    ### 1. **DHCP Snooping**
    
    - Enable **DHCP snooping on switches** to filter DHCP messages.
    - Only allow DHCP responses from **trusted ports** (where legitimate DHCP servers connect).
    - Blocks rogue DHCP servers by dropping unauthorized DHCP offer/ack packets.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **Port Security**
    
    - Use **port security features** on switches to limit MAC addresses per port.
    - Prevents unauthorized devices from connecting and launching DHCP starvation.
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. **IP Source Guard**
    
    - Bind IP addresses to MAC addresses on switches.
    - Ensures that only devices with known MAC-IP bindings can communicate, preventing IP spoofing.
    
    ---
    
    ### 4. **DHCP Authentication**
    
    - Some DHCP implementations support **authentication options** (though rarely used).
    - Use where possible to authenticate DHCP messages between clients and servers.
    
    ---
    
    ### 5. **Network Segmentation**
    
    - Segment networks using VLANs to isolate sensitive devices.
    - Limits the blast radius of DHCP-based attacks.
    
    ---
    
    ### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**
    
    - Monitor DHCP logs and network traffic for unusual patterns.
    - Detect suspicious spikes in DHCP requests or unexpected DHCP servers.
    
    ---
    
    ### 7. **Lease Time Management**
    
    - Use shorter DHCP lease times in high-security environments to reduce the window of IP misuse.
    
    ---
    
    ### 8. **Use of Static IPs for Critical Devices**
    
    - Assign static IPs or DHCP reservations for critical infrastructure to avoid DHCP-related issues.
    
    ---
    
    ### Summary Table
    
    | Vulnerability | Mitigation |
    | --- | --- |
    | Rogue DHCP servers | DHCP Snooping, port security |
    | DHCP starvation | Port security, monitoring |
    | IP spoofing | IP Source Guard, port security |
    | Man-in-the-middle | DHCP Snooping, network segmentation |
    | Lack of authentication | DHCP authentication (if available) |
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > DHCP is vulnerable to rogue servers, starvation attacks, and spoofing due to lack of native authentication and broadcast nature. Mitigation involves enabling DHCP snooping, port security, IP source guard, network segmentation, monitoring, and careful lease management.

- **How does DHCP work in a network with multiple subnets separated by routers?**
    
    # ✅ How DHCP Works in Networks with Multiple Subnets Separated by Routers
    
    ---
    
    ### Problem:
    
    - DHCP clients send **broadcast DHCPDISCOVER messages** to find a DHCP server.
    - **Routers by default do not forward broadcast messages** between subnets.
    - So, a DHCP client on one subnet **cannot directly communicate** with a DHCP server on another subnet using broadcasts.
    
    ---
    
    ### Solution: **DHCP Relay Agent**
    
    ---
    
    ## What is a DHCP Relay Agent?
    
    - A device (usually a router or Layer 3 switch) configured to **listen for DHCP broadcast messages on its subnet**.
    - It **forwards DHCP requests as unicast packets to a DHCP server** located on another subnet.
    - It also relays the DHCP server’s responses back to the client.
    
    ---
    
    ## How It Works Step-by-Step:
    
    1. **Client sends DHCPDISCOVER broadcast** on its local subnet.
    2. **Router with DHCP Relay enabled intercepts the broadcast**.
    3. Relay agent **wraps the DHCP message in a unicast packet** and forwards it to the DHCP server’s IP.
    4. Relay agent adds the **`giaddr` (Gateway IP Address) field** in the DHCP packet indicating the client’s subnet.
    5. **DHCP server receives the request**, reads `giaddr`, and determines which IP pool (scope) to use based on the client’s subnet.
    6. DHCP server sends the **DHCPOFFER back to the relay agent** (unicast).
    7. Relay agent forwards the **DHCPOFFER as a broadcast** on the client’s subnet.
    8. The client receives the offer and proceeds with the DHCP handshake (REQUEST, ACK) through the same relay process.
    
    ---
    
    ## Key Points:
    
    - `giaddr` is critical because it tells the DHCP server **which subnet the client is on**, allowing the server to assign an IP from the correct pool.
    - Multiple subnets can be served by **a single centralized DHCP server** using relay agents.
    - Without DHCP relay, you’d need a DHCP server on every subnet or rely on manual/static IP assignment.
    
    ---
    
    ## Example Use Case:
    
    ```
    pgsql
    CopyEdit
    Subnet A (192.168.1.0/24)       Router with DHCP Relay enabled       DHCP Server (10.0.0.1)

    |-- Broadcast DHCPDISCOVER -------->|                                   |
                                       |--- DHCPDISCOVER unicast --------->|
                                       |<-- DHCPOFFER unicast -------------|
    <-- DHCPOFFER broadcast ------------|                                   |
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > In multi-subnet networks, DHCP relay agents on routers forward DHCP client broadcasts as unicasts to DHCP servers on other subnets. The relay includes the client’s subnet info (giaddr) so the server assigns IPs from the correct subnet pool, enabling centralized DHCP service across segmented networks.

- **Explain how DHCP options work and give examples of custom options you might configure.**
    
    # ✅ How DHCP Options Work
    
    ---
    
    ### What Are DHCP Options?
    
    - DHCP options are **additional pieces of information** included in DHCP messages to provide clients with network configuration parameters beyond just the IP address.
    - They allow the DHCP server to send various settings to clients, making the network configuration **more flexible and comprehensive**.
    - Each option has a **unique numeric code**, a **length field**, and a **value**.
    
    ---
    
    ### How Options Are Used:
    
    - When a DHCP client sends a request (e.g., DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST), it may include a **parameter request list** specifying which options it wants.
    - The DHCP server responds by including **options in the DHCP response messages** (like DHCPOFFER, DHCPACK).
    - Options can include standard parameters (like DNS servers) or **vendor-specific/custom options**.
    
    ---
    
    ### Option Format (Simplified):
    
    | Field | Size (Bytes) | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Option Code | 1 | Identifies the option |
    | Length | 1 | Length of the option data |
    | Data | Variable | Option-specific data |
    
    ---
    
    ### Commonly Used DHCP Options:
    
    | Option Code | Name | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 1 | Subnet Mask | Client’s subnet mask |
    | 3 | Router | Default gateway IP address |
    | 6 | Domain Name Server | DNS server IP addresses |
    | 15 | Domain Name | DNS domain name |
    | 51 | IP Address Lease Time | Duration of the IP lease |
    | 42 | NTP Servers | Network Time Protocol server addresses |
    
    ---
    
    # ✅ Examples of Custom DHCP Options
    
    ---
    
    ### 1. **Vendor-Specific Options (Option 43)**
    
    - Allows vendors to define proprietary options.
    - Commonly used for:
        - IP phones specifying configuration servers.
        - Wireless access points providing vendor-specific configs.
    - Data format inside is vendor-dependent.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **Classless Static Route Option (Option 121)**
    
    - Used to provide clients with static routes in CIDR notation.
    - Allows clients to route traffic for specific networks through different gateways.
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. **Custom Option Example: Boot Server Host Name (Option 66) & Bootfile Name (Option 67)**
    
    - Used in PXE boot environments.
    - Option 66: IP or hostname of the boot server.
    - Option 67: Boot file name to download.
    
    ---
    
    ### 4. **NetBIOS Options (44, 46)**
    
    - For Windows networks, specifying NetBIOS Name Servers or WINS servers.
    
    ---
    
    # How Custom Options Are Configured
    
    - DHCP servers allow admins to define custom options by specifying:
        - Option code.
        - Data type (string, IP address, etc.).
        - Value.
    - Example (Cisco IOS):
    
    ```
    shell
    CopyEdit
    ip dhcp pool DATA
     network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0
     option 150 ip 192.168.10.10
    
    ```
    
    *(Option 150 is often used for TFTP server IP)*
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > DHCP options are flexible parameters sent from the server to clients, enabling comprehensive network configuration beyond IP addressing. Custom options like vendor-specific info, static routes, or boot server details allow DHCP to support specialized network needs.

- **Describe a scenario where DHCP starvation attack occurs and how you would defend against it.**
    
    # ✅ DHCP Starvation Attack: Scenario and Defense
    
    ---
    
    ### 🔍 What is a DHCP Starvation Attack?
    
    - It's a **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack** targeting DHCP servers.
    - The attacker floods the DHCP server with a large number of **fake DHCP requests**, each with a **spoofed unique MAC address**.
    - This exhausts the DHCP server’s available IP address pool.
    - Legitimate clients cannot obtain IP addresses, causing network outages or degraded connectivity.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🛠 Scenario Example:
    
    1. **Attacker’s Setup:**
        - Uses a tool or script to rapidly send DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST messages.
        - Spoofs many unique MAC addresses to simulate many fake clients.
    2. **Impact on Network:**
        - DHCP server allocates IPs to all these fake requests.
        - IP address pool is drained.
        - Legitimate users fail to get IP addresses.
        - Network connectivity for real clients is lost or severely impacted.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🛡 How to Defend Against DHCP Starvation Attacks
    
    ---
    
    ### 1. **Enable DHCP Snooping**
    
    - DHCP snooping is a security feature on switches.
    - It **filters DHCP messages**, allowing only trusted ports (where legitimate DHCP servers reside) to send DHCP offers.
    - Prevents rogue DHCP servers and reduces attack surface.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **Implement Port Security**
    
    - Limit the number of MAC addresses per switch port.
    - Helps prevent an attacker from flooding the network with many fake MAC addresses on a single port.
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. **Use IP Source Guard**
    
    - Ensures that only allowed IP-MAC bindings can send traffic.
    - Blocks traffic from unauthorized IPs or MAC addresses.
    
    ---
    
    ### 4. **Use VLAN Segmentation**
    
    - Isolate sensitive parts of the network.
    - Limits the impact of DHCP starvation attacks to smaller segments.
    
    ---
    
    ### 5. **Monitor and Alert**
    
    - Continuously monitor DHCP server logs and network traffic.
    - Set alerts for unusual spikes in DHCP requests or rapid MAC address changes.
    
    ---
    
    ### 6. **Increase DHCP Pool Size and Use Static Reservations**
    
    - Expand IP address pools to reduce exhaustion risk.
    - Use static reservations for critical devices to ensure they always have IPs.
    
    ---
    
    ### Summary Table
    
    | Defense Mechanism | Purpose |
    | --- | --- |
    | DHCP Snooping | Filter DHCP traffic, prevent rogue servers |
    | Port Security | Limit MAC addresses per port |
    | IP Source Guard | Enforce IP-MAC binding |
    | VLAN Segmentation | Isolate network segments |
    | Monitoring & Alerts | Detect attacks early |
    | Large Pools & Reservations | Reduce exhaustion impact |
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > A DHCP starvation attack floods the DHCP server with fake requests to exhaust IP addresses, denying service to real clients. Defenses include enabling DHCP snooping, port security, IP source guard, VLAN segmentation, and active monitoring.

### Bonus: Scenario/Design

- **You are tasked with designing a DHCP service that supports both wired and wireless clients across multiple VLANs with high availability. How would you approach this?**
    
    # Designing a DHCP Service for Wired & Wireless Clients Across Multiple VLANs with High Availability
    
    ---
    
    ### 1. **Network Segmentation by VLAN**
    
    - Separate wired and wireless clients into distinct VLANs.
    - Assign each VLAN its own IP subnet and corresponding DHCP scope.
    - VLAN separation improves security and traffic management.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **Centralized DHCP Servers with Relay Agents**
    
    - Deploy **centralized DHCP servers** (physical or virtual) in a data center or core network.
    - Configure **DHCP relay agents** (usually on routers or Layer 3 switches) for each VLAN/subnet.
    - Relay agents forward DHCP requests from each VLAN to the centralized DHCP servers.
    - Relay agents include the VLAN’s subnet info (`giaddr`) so the server assigns IPs from the correct scope.
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. **High Availability (HA)**
    
    - Implement DHCP server redundancy using:
        - **DHCP Failover Protocol (RFC 3074)** — pairs two DHCP servers sharing lease info and workload.
        - Vendor-specific clustering solutions.
    - Deploy servers in **active-active** or **active-standby** modes.
    - Ensure failover is transparent; clients continue to get leases without interruption.
    
    ---
    
    ### 4. **Scope and Pool Management**
    
    - Define DHCP scopes per VLAN/subnet with appropriate IP ranges.
    - Use **address reservations** for critical devices (e.g., network printers, servers).
    - Avoid overlapping scopes to prevent conflicts.
    
    ---
    
    ### 5. **Support for Wired and Wireless Clients**
    
    - Wireless clients get DHCP via the VLAN assigned to wireless SSIDs.
    - Ensure **wireless controllers or access points forward DHCP requests properly** via relay agents.
    - Address potential differences in lease times or options for wireless (e.g., faster renewal times).

    ### 6. **Security Measures**
    
    - Enable **DHCP snooping** on switches to prevent rogue DHCP servers.
    - Use **port security** to limit MAC addresses per port.
    - Implement **IP Source Guard** for IP-MAC binding.
    - Monitor DHCP traffic for anomalies.
    
    ---
    
    ### 7. **Monitoring and Logging**
    
    - Centralize DHCP logs for performance monitoring and troubleshooting.
    - Set alerts for lease pool exhaustion or DHCP server issues.
    
    ---
    
    ### 8. **Automation and IPAM Integration**
    
    - Use **IP Address Management (IPAM)** tools to manage IP pools and reservations.
    - Automate DHCP server configurations and scope updates using tools like Ansible.

- **How would you troubleshoot a situation where clients are unable to obtain IP addresses from the DHCP server?**
    
    # ✅ Troubleshooting DHCP: Clients Unable to Obtain IP Addresses
    
    ---
    
    ### 1. **Verify Physical and Link Layer Connectivity**
    
    - Check if the client’s network interface is up and connected.
    - Ensure the switch port is active, and the cable is functional.
    - Confirm the client is connected to the correct VLAN or network segment.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **Check Client Configuration**
    
    - Verify the client is set to obtain IP automatically (DHCP enabled).
    - On the client, run commands like:
        - Windows: `ipconfig /renew`
        - Linux/macOS: `dhclient` or `dhcpcd` commands.
    - Check for any static IP configuration that might interfere.
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. **Analyze DHCP Message Flow**
    
    - Use packet capture tools (Wireshark, tcpdump) on client and server sides.
    - Look for DHCPDISCOVER broadcasts from clients.
    - Confirm if DHCPOFFER messages are sent by the server.
    - If no DISCOVER or OFFER, locate where packets are dropped.
    
    ---
    
    ### 4. **Check DHCP Server Status**
    
    - Verify the DHCP service is running.
    - Check DHCP server logs for errors or warnings.
    - Ensure DHCP scopes are active, not exhausted, and have available IPs.
    - Confirm lease duration settings.
    
    ---
    
    ### 5. **Inspect Network Devices**
    
    - Check DHCP relay agent configurations on routers/switches:
        - Is DHCP relay enabled on interfaces connected to clients?
        - Is the relay agent forwarding requests to the correct DHCP server IP?
    - Verify no ACLs or firewall rules block DHCP traffic (UDP ports 67 and 68).
    - Ensure no rogue DHCP servers are interfering.
    
    ---
    
    ### 6. **Check VLAN and Subnet Configuration**
    
    - Confirm the client’s VLAN is correctly tagged and trunked across switches.
    - Ensure DHCP server has a scope for the client’s subnet.
    - Check `giaddr` field in DHCP packets if relay agents are used.
    
    ---
    
    ### 7. **Verify Security Features**
    
    - Check if DHCP snooping or port security is enabled and correctly configured.
    - Verify if these features are not blocking legitimate DHCP messages.
    - Look for port security violations.
    
    ---
    
    ### 8. **Client-Side Logs and Events**
    
    - Review client event logs or system messages related to DHCP.
    - Look for errors like “No DHCP offers received” or lease request failures.
    
    ---
    
    ### 9. **Test with a Known Good Device**
    
    - Connect a known working device to the same port to rule out client-specific issues.
    - Alternatively, connect the problematic client to a different network segment where DHCP is known to work.
    
    ---
    
    ### 10. **Restart Services or Devices**
    
    - Restart DHCP server service if necessary.
    - Restart network devices (switches, routers) as a last resort.
    - Reboot the client device.

    ## 🧠 Interview Summary:
    
    > To troubleshoot DHCP failures, verify physical connectivity, client settings, DHCP server status, and network device configurations. Capture DHCP traffic to trace request/offer flow, check relay agents and VLAN setups, and inspect security settings like DHCP snooping. Testing with alternate devices and reviewing logs helps isolate the problem.
